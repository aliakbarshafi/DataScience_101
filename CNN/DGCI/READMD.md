This project is based on the Turf Grass Images from the Department of Soil and Crop Sciences, Texas A&M. The aesthetic quality of turf is often evaluated in field studies. In some contexts, digital image analysis provides a quantitative means to inform researchers. The dark green color index (DGCI) is a criterion aimed at direct comparison with visual ratings. The goal is to use CNN to estimate the missing DGCI indices.
