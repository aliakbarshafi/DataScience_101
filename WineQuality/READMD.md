## Wine Quality
The Wine Quality Data aggregated objective tests about various wines. The output is based on sensory data (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded wine quality between 0 (bad) and 10 (excellent).
The goal of this mini project was to explore linear regression model and Decision trees to predict the wine quality.
