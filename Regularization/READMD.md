## World Bank Data

The World Bank Data aggregates the population of various countries, along with fertility rate and life expectancy, from 1960 to 2016. The goal of this mini project was to explore a regression analysis method that performs both variable selection and regularization in order to enhance the prediction accuracy and limit the fragility of a statistical model.
