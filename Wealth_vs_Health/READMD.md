## Investigative Journalism

The goal of this project is to support or refute the claim: income level is positively correlated to health. Pertinent well-being indicators may include diabetes and obesity rates, although the teams are encouraged to be creative about information sources. Public data sets are identified, and they should be viewed as a starting point.


## Data
### Data 1 – Food Environment Atlas
Food environment factors interact to influence food choices and diet quality. The objectives of the Food Atlas, made available by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, are to assemble statistics on food environment indicators and to provide a spatial overview of access to healthy food. The atlas contains health and well-being indicators such as diabetes and obesity rates.

### Data 2 – Individual Income Tax Statistics
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is the revenue service of the United States federal government. It is responsible for collecting taxes and administering the Internal Revenue Code.
The IRS makes data products available to the public; this data is collected and curated primarily as part of the Statistics of Income (SOI) program. Public information includes individual tax statistics for 2016, grouped by ZIP code.

### Data 3 – Spatial Information
[Federal Information Processing Standards](https://www.nist.gov/itl/itl-publications/federal-information-processing-standards-fips) (FIPS) are publicly announced standards developed by the United States federal government for use in computer systems. The FIPS county codes uniquely identify counties and county equivalents in the United States, certain U.S. possessions, and certain freely associated states.
